            <h3>Porpuse</h3>
            <p>The main purpose of my Point of the Mountain chamber website is to build revenue. 
                To do this I want to give the customers the opportunity to know what we
                offer as a vacation company. I would like to help potential clients 
                which want to try climb for the first time to know what to expect 
                and to find answers to their doubts, to know our safety measures and 
                what kind of activities can they live in Point of the Mountain. 
                And for those with experience in climbing I would like to show why our 
                company has what they are looking for to have a safe and adventure time. 
                This site should show all the activities that our company offers.
