        <p id="p1">Matamoros, officially known as Heroica Matamoros, is a city in the northeastern Mexican state 
            of Tamaulipas. It is on the southern bank of the Rio Grande, directly across the border from Brownsville,
             Texas, United States.
    
            The economy of the city is significantly based on its international trade with the United States through 
            the USMCA agreement,and it is home to one of the most promising industrial sectors in Mexico,
             mainly due to the presence of maquiladoras. In Matamoros, the automotive industry hosts the assembly 
             and accessories plants for brands such as General Motors, Ford, Chrysler, BMW, and Mercedes Benz.
              Prior to the growth of the maquiladoras in the 2000s, Matamoros' economy had historically been 
              principally based on agriculture, since northern Mexico's biggest irrigation zones are in the municipality.
              PEMEX announced a multibillion-peso offshore drilling project for the port of Matamoros,
               one of the future prospects for Mexico's oil industry.</p>

        <p id="p2">The Gateway International Bridge/Puente Internacional Matamoros (o more affectionately, 
        the “puente nuevo”) is a symbolic and literal tie between Mexico and the United States through the border 
        communities of Matamoros, Tamaulipas and Brownsville, Texas. In addition to appreciating the bridge’s 
        function and symbolic value it is worth taking into consideration the sets of buildings on opposite ends
         of this Rio Grande border crossing, particularly in the southbound direction towards Matamoros.</p>

        <p id="p3"> The Bagdad beach is an special part of Matamoros, you can do all sorts of water activities such as
         fishing or swimming; and you can also take advantage of its dunes for walks ATV. 
         The place has palapas and restaurants to enjoy the soft sand and relax under the sun.
        It is also at this beach is held the Festival of the Sea every Easter where there are artistic

        <p id="p4"> La Gran Puerta de México Monument. Since Matamoros is a Mexican border city with USA it can be considered a gateway
             into Mexico so it makes sense that Sebastián’s sculpture in the city would be a conceptual representation of such a portal.
              the sculpture consists of two curved towers united by a cube, giving it the appearance of a capital 
              letter “M.”Per the creator, the “M” stands for 
             both Matamoros and Mexico.
             The sculpture is located in the city’s Parque Cultural Olímpico (Olympic Cultural Park) Where we can find museums, libraries,
              an acustic shell, excercise and recreation areas. </p>

        <p id="p5">The calle 9 in Matamoros Tamaulipas, is the street that conects two of the three international bidges with 
        the city dowtow. Every friday in this street takes place an event called "La Callejoneada", where the people from 
    Matamoros take a walk by this street and local markets sell their products as food, snacks and  handicrafts.
